Entity-Component-System
Discovering Entity Component System (ECS) was an "ah-hah" moment for me. 
With ECS, entities are just collections of components; just a collection of data.

Entity: An entity is just an ID
Component: Components are just data.
System: Logic that runs on every entity that has a component of the system. 
For example, a "Renderer" system would draw all entities that have a "appearance" component.

var entity = new Entity();
 entity.addComponent( new Health() );
